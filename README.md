Here is the basic structure of our Text-Hashtag based model:

The original paper can be found in here
Li, J., Xu, Q., Shah, N., & Mackey, T. K. (2019). A machine learning approach for the detection and characterization of illicit drug dealers on instagram: model evaluation study. Journal of medical Internet research, 21(6), e13803.

P.S. This is a clean version of our Text-Hashtag-Based mdoel, our original code is a little bit mess so we are trying to organize it in a much better way, this version doesn't contain the test based on Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine, we will upload the new version soon
